### David Marchena's Fetch Rewards Data Analyst Coding Exercise

#### Section 1:
My data model diagram is in DataModelDiagram.pdf.  I created it using dbdiagram.io, which uses DBML to generate a customizable diagram.  

One note about the diagram:  I did not include every possible field from the rewardsReceiptItemList in the ReceiptItemList table, like the descriptions, a handful of fields that only appeared on a few receipt items, etc.  These could be included in a final model, but aren't necessary for the business questions.

#### Section 2:
My queries are in Stakeholder_Questions.sql.  I chose to write queries answering the first and third business questions, though the model should be able to answer all six (given quality data).

#### Section 3:
I used a python 3 Jupyter notebook for my data quality exploration.  This notebook is 'Data Exploration and Quality Issues.ipynb', but I've also included an HTML version if you don't have quick access to run it in Jupyter.

#### Section 4:
My stakeholder email is in "Questions about your receipts data.pdf"


Thanks for reviewing my exercise! Please let me know your feedback and when I can expect to hear about next steps.
